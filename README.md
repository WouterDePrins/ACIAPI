# ACIAPI

This application, written in HTML5, is a showcase how you could interact with the Cisco ACI REST API.
It allows you to create Tenants, VRF's, AP's, BD's, EPG's and link them to a VMM domain. Another module is to create Contracts, Filters, Entries and Subject. Don't use in production. Showcase only.
